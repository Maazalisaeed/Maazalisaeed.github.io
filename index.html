    <p class="card-text"> I would like to be Deputy head boy so I can make a change.I would like to make bonding and learning more fun for all.
                Being Deputy Head Boy is not about being better than anyone else, it's about doing the best I can for everyone including listening to your ideas (not just my own) and carrying them out to the best of my ability, representing the
                Beaconhouse College and upholding the 'outstanding' reputation. In the interest and benefits of students, the decisions are taken by the administration and teachers. Sometimes, the communication gap does not properly able the students understand the benefits If I will be elected, I will act as a buffer between respectable teachers and dear students to overcome this communication barrier that's the way the students may benefit from the decision made by the administration and teachers.
                Please vote for me, as you definitely will not regret it if I become Deputy head boy because I will always respect and value you as individuals, and always be 100% dedicated to my role.</p>
